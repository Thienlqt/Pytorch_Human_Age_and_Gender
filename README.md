# Pytorch_Human_Age_and_Gender
This is a project I did on a subject at my university, Introduction to Computer Science. The project is simply about age and gender detection using Pytorch and Resnet50 architecture. The model's precision is about 80%, which is not a large number, but it's a good start. Thank you for visiting, I hope that this project finds you well.
